Notes
=====

* Each test use zero fortification of fully levelled T4s.
* These results should only be used for verifying the simulator, rather for suggesting such combinations, unless until it is more stable.

Some Reports Conclusions
========================

* Uldred is good! But with the best known setting in these reports he still cannot compete with AJ + Morrigan. The key could be that the Jowan team members are almost all row attackers. So that may not charge the blood mage on the opponent side too much as the charging was calculated from damage dealt. Plus 3 Morrigans would stun like hell.
* One report replace 3 VAs with 3 Morrigans to see if this is all the works of the magical girls. It turns out that it didn't help much. Could just be the apostate aura in the end.
