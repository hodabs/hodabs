* Thinking of quitting due to this KM thing. Sooner or later.
  Not that because I think 10% isn't right. I have 4 KMs but
  never leg-fort my health slots because I feel 20% is broken
  in the sense that they will not be able to have an LC that
  does 20% DR for allies, even an ultra rare one. The stats
  are never be the problem, the problem is they treat the
  community with <del>bad</del> ill faith.

* Reports folder has been started.

* KFN insulted The Almighty Fashion so much and be banned
  and decided not to get back to the forum.

* Future contributors are free to contribute through the
  usual github interface or via the forum, without a forum
  response the project will do at his best to update with
  the requested reports and will be made avaiable as a part
  of the source tree.

  TODO
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. Generalize fortifaction.
  2. Taunt
  3. Flemeth
  4. Fixing defender.. I admit I hate working with this poorly
     implemented mechanics, breaking with BM and etc. It feels
     just sad to implement broken things with good code.
  5. Make a public doc so anyone can put their teams and they will
     periodically be tested and published.
